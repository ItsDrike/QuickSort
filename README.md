# QuickSort

This uses **pygame** to visualize Bubble Sort algorithm.<br>
I decided to use line length as distinctive feature which will get sorted for best list/array visualization.

NOTE: This is a re-upload of a project I made several years ago.

## Final result

Example list: `[12, 58, 21, 13, 18, 42, 35, 49, 10, 3, 50, 28, 55, 1, 8, 3, 24, 49]`

Result:
